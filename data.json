This 46-storey tower will dazzle amongst the city skyline as architectural firm Page + Steel/IBI Group creates a diamond-patterned masterpiece.\n\nPrime Condos will offer a mix of studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units.\n\nPrime Condos will offer a buzzing podium that will include retail space, 24-hour concierge service, a wrap-around outdoor terrace, and indoor/outdoor amenities.

This University is in high-demand and has unrivalled growth in student admissions over Ontario’s leading schools. 7,000 undergraduate students have been admitted to Ryerson University over the past five years. As a post-secondary school with the highest admission rate during that time frame, Ryerson has the least housing for students compared to the University of Toronto and York University.\n\nStudent housing is under-serviced in the Ryerson University area as the housing market has not kept pace with the growth in student population.
